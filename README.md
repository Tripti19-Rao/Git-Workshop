# Git-Workshop

Hey Devs :octocat:

This repository was created in order to learn about git and github. Let us follow the :point_right: steps given below 
***
### :point_right: Step 1

Go to this website [Github-Workshop](https://git-workshop.netlify.app/) :cloud: the first thing you see after opening the website is that it contains plenty of cards and each card has its own name **Card title** So now we are going to change the name of any one of the card from **Card title** to **Your Text**.

### :point_right: Step 2

In the top Right corner of this page you can see the **Fork symbol :fork_and_knife:** click on that and it will create a copy of code :page_facing_up: to your 
github Repository :pushpin:

### :point_right: Step 3

While you are in the forked repository of the github page, there you can see the green text-box **Code** click on that and copy the **https** URL and now we will have to clone this repository :closed_book: to our local machine :computer: by this command 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Git-Workshop
```
### :point_right: Step 4

Now lets go the the **Git-Workshop** folder by running this command :pencil2:

```linux
cd Git-Workshop
```
So, now you are in the **Git-Workshop** directory lets go to the folder **dist** where ' index.html ' file is present
```linux
cd dist
```
let us open :open_file_folder: the 'index.html file'
