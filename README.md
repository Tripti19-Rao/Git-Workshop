### :point_right: Step 1

Go to this website [Github-Workshop](https://git-workshop.netlify.app/) :cloud: the first thing you see after opening the website is that it contains plenty of cards and each card has its own name **Card title** So now we are going to change the name of any one of the card from **Card title** to **Your Text**
